	<p> As promised, here is a somewhat 
		condensed version of my life story. I grew up in a military family, so I got to live in lots of different
		places, including England, Arkansas, Mississippi, and primarily Alaska. I was homeschooled until I started college, which
		allowed me to spend lots of time with my siblings and dogs in our igloo (just kidding, 
		we lived in a house- I've never even seen an igloo in real life).</p>
	
	<p> I studied first at the University of Alaska Anchorage, where I got my BS in Mathematics with a minor in English in 2015. While 
		I was in college I filled my spare time by doing data entry and statistics at my mom's midwifery clinic
		and leading the youth group at my church. I also spent part of my summers working at a rural bible camp in Unalakleet, Alaska.</p>
	
	<p> In May 2020 I received my PhD from the University of Kentucky, working on algebraic geometry with Dr. 
		Dave Jensen. That research focuses on calculating the scrollar invariants of tropical curves, though I'm interested in lots of other
		fun combinatorial questions as well.  </p>
	
	<p> From August 2020 to May 2022, I was a Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow at the Colorado School of Mines, where I got to teach a variety of upper and lower division
		math courses and and expand my collection of teaching techniques and practices. 
		I also did some really neat projects with a few undergraduates and learned that undergraduate research is really fun! I hope to keep working on problems at this level. </p>
	
	<p> Since 2022, my husband Hunter and I have worked as Academic Professionals at Georgia Tech, and we have learned to love living in Atlanta.
		Though I spend most of my time working, I also like to spend time with friends, play with our kids and giant puppy, cook, play games, 
		hammock, hike, climb rocks, and pretty much anything else outside. Thanks for reading! </p>
