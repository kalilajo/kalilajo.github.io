	<p> As promised, here is a somewhat 
		condensed version of my life story. I grew up in a military family, so I got to live in lots of different
		places, including England, Arkansas, Mississippi, and primarily Alaska. I was homeschooled until I started college, which
		was super fun and allowed me to spend lots of time with my siblings and dogs in our igloo (just kidding, 
		we actually have a house- I've never even seen an igloo in real life).</p>
	<p> I went to college at the University of Alaska, where I got my BS in Mathematics with a minor in English in 2015. While 
		I was in college I filled my spare time by doing data entry and statistics at my mom's midwifery clinic
		and leading the youth group at my church. I also spent part of my summers working at a bible camp in Unalakleet, Alaska,
		which is now one of my favorite places.</p>
	<p> The summer after I graduated, I moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and started grad school at the University of Kentucky.
		Since earning my Masters degree in 2017, I have continued to study algebraic geometry with Dr. 
		Dave Jensen, and plan to graduate in spring 2020. My current research focuses on calculating the scrollar invariants of tropical curves. Though I spend most of my time doing research and teaching, I also like to hang out with my friends, cook, play games, 
		solve rubiks cubes, hammock, hike, and pretty much anything else outside. Thanks for reading! </p>
