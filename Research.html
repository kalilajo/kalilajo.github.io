	<p> My research interests lie in the field of algebraic geometry. In particular, most of my work so far uses tools from tropical geometry
		to study the scrollar invariants of curves. </p> 
	<p>I also like to think about algebra and combinatorics, especially tableaux and graph 
        theory, and I think the Catalan numbers are super cool. </p>
	<p> These days, I don't have opportunity to do much mathematical research since officially my time is split between teaching and administration, but I have spent a lot 
		of time in the last couple of years thinking about accessibilty and implementing good design into my courses, and dipping my toes into the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. </p>
