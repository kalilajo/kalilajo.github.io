	<p> Hello! My name is Kalila Sawyer, and I'm a postdoctoral teaching fellow at the Colorado School of Mines. This is my website, where you can find useful information about how to contact me, 
		what class I'm teaching, and other fun things like my CV, research, and abbreviated life story.</p>
	<p> My office is located in Stratton 213.
	<p> For Fall 2021, my office hours will be by appointment to allow us both more flexibility. From 9-12am on MWF and 3-5pm on Tuesdays, you can schedule an appointment (in person or on Zoom) 
		online (at least 2 hours in advance) at this site: <a target="_blank" href = "https://tinyurl.com/4ecmuk48">Schedule Here</a></p>
	<p> If these times are not compatible with your schedule, please email me to set up an alternate meeting, or just stop by to see if I'm around. </p>
	<p> My email address is <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ksawyer@mines.edu">ksawyer(at)mines.edu.</a></p>
